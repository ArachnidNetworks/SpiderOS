########################SPIDEROS EMBEDDED SYSTEM MANUAL#########################

Sometimes Buildroot produces images too large for the target hardware, and the
goal is to produce the lightest system possible. The SpiderOS embedded system
build toolkit is a simple way to produce a working Linux chroot running busybox
and the latest linux kernel, with a "toybox" for additional apps like fsck.

############INSTALLATION############

Assuming the chroot is being built ON THE TARGET ARCHITECTURE, run the below
scripts with root permissions in order:

1) SpiderOS*/Embedded/SystemBuild/mkroot.sh
2) SpiderOS*/Embedded/CustomKernel/BuildCustomKernel.sh

Once these complete, install the tools you would into the chroot by using make
on the host machine.

To perform a cross-compilation of mkroot, see the documentation provided in
SpiderOS*/Docs.
